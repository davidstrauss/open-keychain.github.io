[**K-9 Mail 5.200**](https://k9mail.github.io/2016/12/26/K-9-Mail-5.200-released.html) has been released, which finally supports the PGP/MIME standard.
It also provides a new user interface for even easier end-to-end encryption.

Support for PGP/MIME required a lot of internal changes and extensions to K-9 Mail to get it working with [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/).
[Vincent Breitmoser](https://github.com/valodim) did most of the work on this.
He was able to work on it full-time for a year thanks to the generous [funding](https://www.opentech.fund/project/k-9-mail) of the [Open Tech Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/).
A huge thank you to them!

We also like to thank [cketti](https://github.com/cketti), the maintainer of K-9 Mail, and all other contributors, especially [Philip Whitehouse](https://github.com/philipwhiuk) who contributed a lot of patches.

The new version should be available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9) and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.fsck.k9) shortly.
If you can't wait, go [grab the APK from GitHub](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/releases/tag/5.200).
